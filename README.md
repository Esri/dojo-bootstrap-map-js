# dojo-bootstrap-map-js

An application boilerplate demonstrating how to use the Esri [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](//js.arcgis.com) with [Bootstrap Map](//github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js) and [Dojo Bootstrap](//github.com/xsokev/Dojo-Bootstrap) to create a responsive mapping application using [Bootstrap](//getbootstrap.com) components.

This boilerplate is ideal for mobile-first applications because it combines the responsive layout of Bootstrap with the ability optimize the JavaScript and CSS code by running a Dojo build. Furthermore, it does not incur the overhead of loading jQuery on the page, which is essentially redundant once you've already loaded Dojo.

The goal of this application boilerplate is to demonstrate how to build a mapping application that utilizes the best parts of Dojo (AMD modules, classes and widgets, promises, i18n, routing, custom builds, etc) along with the responsive UI of Bootstrap. NOTE: not all of the above have been incorporated into this boilerplate yet.

For simpler examples of how to get started with [Bootstrap Map](//github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js) and [Dojo Bootstrap](//github.com/xsokev/Dojo-Bootstrap), see the [Boostrap Map demo pages](http://esri.github.io/bootstrap-map-js/demo/dojo/getstarted.html).
