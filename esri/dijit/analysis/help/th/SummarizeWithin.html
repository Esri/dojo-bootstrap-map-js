    <p>This tool finds features (and portions of features) that are within the boundaries of areas in the analysis layer.  For example:
        <ul>
            <li>Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed. 
            </li>
            <li>Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only those features in the analysis layer and the layer to be summarized that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all features in both the analysis layer and the  layer to be summarized will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

            <p>This is an attribute of the  <b>Summarize</b> features that you can use to calculate statistics separately for each unique attribute value. For example, suppose the analysis layer contains city boundaries and the <b>Summarize</b>  features are parcels.  One of the attributes of the parcels is <i>Status</i> which contains two values: VACANT and OCCUPIED. To calculate the total area of vacant and occupied parcels within the boundaries of cities,  use <i>Status</i> as the group by attribute.
 The statistics for each group, as well as the count of features within each area boundary, will be displayed in the result layer's pop-up.
