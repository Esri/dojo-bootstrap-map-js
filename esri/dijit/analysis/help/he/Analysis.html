            <p>Areas that overlap or share a common boundary are merged together to form a single area.

            <p>You can control which boundaries are merged by specifying a field. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a  <i>State_Name</i> attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the <i>State_Name</i> attribute.  Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for <i>State_Name</i>.  The end result is a layer of state boundaries.
