    <p>Plan Routes determines how to efficiently divide tasks among a
mobile workforce.
    </p>
    <p>You provide the tool with a set of stops and the number of vehicles available to visit the stops.
The tool assigns the stops to vehicles and returns routes showing how each vehicle can reach their
assigned stops in the least amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>With Plan Routes, mobile workforces reach more jobsites in less time, which increases productivity
and improves customer service.
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect homes, restaurants, or construction sites
                

            </li>
            <li>Provide repair, installation, or technical services
            </li>
            <li>Deliver items and small packages
            </li>
            <li>Make sales calls
            </li>
            <li>Transport people from their homes to an event
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>The output from Plan Routes includes a layer of stops coded by the routes to which they are assigned, a layer of routes showing the shortest paths to visit assigned  stops, and, depending on whether any stops could not be reached,  a layer of unassigned stops. 
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features that are visible within the current map extent will be considered in the analysis.  If unchecked, all features in the input layer will be considered, even if they are outside the current map extent.

            <p>Specify where and when the vehicles start their routes.
            </p>
            <p>With Plan Routes you can specify one or many starting locations for
your vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>When one point location is specified, all vehicles depart from
that point regardless of the number of vehicles available.
You can choose a point layer with one point or add a point to the
map by choosing  <b>Add point to map</b>, clicking the adjacent point editing button, and clicking on the map. 
            </p>
            <p>When multiple locations are specified, each vehicle needs to be
associated with its own point. The number of vehicles must match
the number of points in the layer. Choose a layer with multiple points and
specify a field that uniquely identifies the individual
routes, vehicles, or drivers in the  <b>Route ID
field</b> drop-down list.
            </p>
            <p>The starting time is the same for all routes. The time zone for the start time is the same as the time zone in which the starting point or points are located, so
make certain the time you enter is local time. For instance, assume
you are in Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8:00) and the vehicles you
are routing are stationed in Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7:00). If
it is currently 9:30 a.m. PST (10:30 a.m. MST) and your vehicles need to begin their
routes in 30 minutes, you would set the start time to 11:00
a.m. 
            </p>
            <p>If your vehicles start from different time zones, the start time can't be simultaneous; instead, they are offset. For instance, if one route starts from a point in PST and another route starts from MST, and you enter 11:00 a.m. as the start time, the route in PST will start at 11:00 a.m. PST and the route in MST will start at 11:00 a.m. MST&mdash;a one-hour difference.

            <p>Specify where the vehicles end their routes.
            </p>
            <p>You can configure the routes to end in one of three locations: 
                <ul>
                    <li>The same location where the routes began, regardless of whether they originated from one or many locations
                    </li>
                    <li>A single location
                    </li>
                    <li>Many locations&mdash;that is, one ending point for each route
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Check  <b>Return to start</b> if the vehicles start
and end their routes at the same locations.
            </p>
            <p>To route all vehicles to a common ending point other than the
starting point, uncheck  <b>Return to start</b> and
either add a point to the map or choose a layer that contains exactly one
point.
            </p>
            <p>To have routes end at unique locations, uncheck  <b>Return to start</b> and choose a layer containing more
than one point. The number of vehicles must equal the number of
points in the chosen layer. In the <b>Route ID
field</b> drop-down list, choose a field that uniquely identifies
the individual routes, vehicles, or drivers. If the vehicles are
starting at multiple locations and ending at multiple locations,
the route IDs chosen for the starting and ending layers need to
match.

            <p>Specify the number of vehicles that are available to visit the stops. The tool supports up to 100 vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>The tool may be able to find a solution that uses fewer vehicles than the number you specify here depending on  the total number of stops, how many stops per vehicle you allow, how far apart the stops are, the time spent at each stop, and any limit you set on the total route time per vehicle.

            <p>This is one of two parameters that balance the overall workload across routes. You can specify a value between 1 and 200.
            </p>
            <p>By lowering the maximum number of stops that can be assigned to each vehicle, the vehicles are more likely to have an equal number of stops assigned to them. This helps balance workloads among drivers. The drawback, however, is that it may result in a solution that is less efficient.
            </p>
            <p>By increasing the stops per vehicle, the tool has more freedom to find more efficient solutions; however, the workload my be unevenly distributed among drivers and vehicles. Note that you can balance workloads by time as well as by number of stops by specifying a value for the  <b>Limit the total route time per vehicle</b> parameter.
            </p>
            <p>The following examples demonstrate the effects of limiting the maximum stops per vehicle or the total time per vehicle. In all examples there are six stops and two routes, which start at the same location.
