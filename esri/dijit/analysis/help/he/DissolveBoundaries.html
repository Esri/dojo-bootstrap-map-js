        <hr/>
    <p>Areas that overlap or share a common boundary are merged together to form a single area.    
    </p>
    <p>You can control which boundaries are merged by specifying a field. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a  <i>State_Name</i> attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the <i>State_Name</i> attribute.  Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for <i>State_Name</i>.  The end result is a layer of state boundaries.

        <div>
            <p>You can choose one of two methods for merging area features:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Areas that overlap or are adjacent</b>&mdash;Two or more areas whose boundaries overlap each other will be merged into one area.  In addition, areas that are adjacent (that is, they share a common boundary) will be merged into one area.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Areas with the same field value</b>&mdash;Areas that overlap or share a common boundary will be merged into one area if they have the same field value.
                        <p>For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a  <i>State_Name</i> field, you can dissolve boundaries using the <i>State_Name</i> field.  Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for <i>State_Name</i>.  The end result is a layer of state boundaries.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features in the analysis layer visible within the current map extent will be dissolved.  If unchecked, all features in  the analysis layer will be dissolved, even if they are outside the current map extent.

        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>When areas are merged, you can summarize their attributes.  For example, if you are dissolving the boundary between counties based on  <i>State_Name</i>, and each county has a <i>Population</i> field, you could calculate the sum of <i>Population</i> for the state.
            </p>
            <p>Available statistics types are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Sum</b>&mdash;Adds the total value for the specified field
                    

                </li>
                <li> <b>Average</b>&mdash;Calculates the average for the specified field
                    

                </li>
                <li> <b>Minimum</b>&mdash;Finds the smallest value for all records of the specified field
                    

                </li>
                <li> <b>Maximum</b>&mdash;Finds the largest value for all records of the specified field
                    

                </li>
                <li> <b>Std. Deviation</b>&mdash;Finds the standard deviation on values in the specified field
