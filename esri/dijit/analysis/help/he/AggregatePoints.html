        <hr/>
    <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features (the analysis layer) and a layer of area features. It first
determines which points fall within each area. After determining
this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all
points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well. 
    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have point features of coffee shop locations and area features of counties, and you want to summarize coffee sales by county.  Assuming the  coffee shops have a    <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within each county, or the minimum or maximum <i>TOTAL_SALES</i>
 within each county, or the standard deviation of all sales within each county.
    </p>
    <p>The result  is a map where the color of each area is based on the total number of points divided by the size of the area.  Dividing counts by area is known as normalization, and it is a technique cartographers always use to display data by areas.  Normalization helps to better understand spatial patterns because the size of the area is  taken into account when areas are visually compared to each other.
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features in the analysis and area layer visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all features in both the analysis layer and the area layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

select from the list of boundary layers available to
you in ArcGIS Online. Any points that fall within the boundaries of
areas in this layer will be counted and optionally summarized using your choices of
statistics.

            <p>You can calculate statistics about attributes of the input point layer such as sum, mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. The result layer will
contain a new attribute for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic (a new drop-down box will appear).

        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>You can create statistical groups using an attribute in the analysis layer.    For example, if you are aggregating crimes to neighborhood boundaries, you may have an attribute  <i>Crime_type</i> with five different crime types.  Each unique crime type forms a group, and the statistics you choose will be calculated for each unique value of <i>Crime_type</i>.  The statistics for each group, as well as the count of points, will be displayed in the result layer's pop-up.  When you choose a grouping attribute, two results are created: the result layer and a result table containing the statistics for each unique group.

When you select <b>Add minority, majority</b>, two new fields are added to your result layer.   If you also select <b>Add percentages</b>, two additional fields are added to the result layer containing the percentages of the minority and majority attribute values within each group.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you are a city planner and you want to find out which tree species are in the minority and which are in the majority within all city parks, aggregate your tree data with your park areas and check this option.
