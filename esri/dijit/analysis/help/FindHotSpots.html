        <hr/>
    <p>The Find Hot Spots tool will determine if there is any statistically significant clustering in the spatial pattern of your data. 
        <ul>
            <li>Are your points (crime incidents, trees, traffic accidents) really clustered?  How can you be sure?
            </li>
            <li>Have you truly discovered a statistically significant hot spot (for spending, infant mortality, consistently high test scores) or would your map tell a different story if you changed the way it was symbolized?
            </li>
        </ul>
        The Find Hot Spots tool will help you answer these questions with confidence.

            <p>This analysis answers the question: Where do high and low values (for an analysis field you specify) cluster spatially?  
            </p>
            <p>The result layer will be a copy of the analysis layer.  The table will include the  analysis field you selected plus additional fields reflecting clustering strength, statistical significance, and confidence level.

            <p>If you provide an analysis field, this tool will answer the question: Where do high and low values cluster among the points? 
            </p>
            <p>The result layer will be a copy of the point analysis layer.  The table will include the analysis field you selected plus additional fields reflecting clustering strength, statistical significance, and confidence level.
            </p>
            <p>If you do not provide an analysis field, this tool will evaluate the spatial arrangement of the point features to answer the question: Where are points unexpectedly clustered or spread out?   
            </p>
            <p>When no analysis field is provided, the tool creates a fishnet mesh and counts the number of points that fall within each fishnet square. Only squares with point counts larger than zero are analyzed.  The result layer is the fishnet squares; the result layer table includes the count values plus additional fields reflecting clustering strength, statistical significance, and confidence level.

            </p>
            <p>The area features you draw or the features in the area layer you specify should define where points could possibly occur.  To draw these areas, click the draw button then click on the map to create an area shape.  To draw additional areas, click the draw button again, then click on the map and continue.
            </p>
            <p>Note: If you want to overlay your points with areas other than a fishnet mesh,  <b>Provide aggregation areas for summing incidents</b>.

            <p>The result layer for this analysis will be a fishnet mesh covering the bounding areas you provide.  The table will include the fishnet square point counts plus additional fields reflecting clustering strength, statistical significance, and confidence level.

            </p>
            <p>The result layer for this analysis will be a copy of the aggregation areas.  The table will include the  point counts for each area plus additional fields reflecting clustering strength, statistical significance, and confidence level.
